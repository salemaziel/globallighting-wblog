##**BEFORE**
This former chopshop-turned-volunteer-firestation had old, yellow lights in their building when we arrived. These lights took several minutes just to turn on; not helpful in an emergency!

##**AFTER**
We installed some high-powered white LED lights all throughout their station and office. Much better!
