            <h3>About the Global Lighting Project</h3>
            <div className="blurb">
              <p>
                The <strong>Global Lighting Project</strong> is a 501c3
                non-profit that is on a mission to ensure all people have access
                to light, electricity, clean water, and the ability to disinfect
                their facilities using cutting edge LED light technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally founded in 2016 in San Diego, California, the Global
                Lighting Project team first set out to bring energy and light to
                impoverished communities in India, where many live daily without
                access to light or electricity.
                <br></br>
                The team at Global Lighting Project researches, builds or
                purchases, and transports this LED technology to local
                organizations working in the communities we seek to benefit. We
                act as a supplier, distributor and educator for these local
                groups, donating LED light kits and educating them on how the
                technology works, so that they, in turn, can bring that
                knowledge and technology to their communities to share and teach
                others.

          <h3 style={{ color: "#ffc529" }}>The Need:</h3>
          <p>
            Over 1.6 Billion people live without reliable access to electricity,
            clean water, sanitary cooking facilities, or the resources necessary
            to grow food.
            <br />
            The Global Lighting Project is on a mission to change that.
          </p>
          <h3 style={{ color: "#ffc529" }}>Our Vision:</h3>
          <p>
            We envision a world where renewable energy is accessible by all
            people to use at their discretion for the betterment of their
            communities.
          </p>
          <h3 style={{ color: "#ffc529" }}>Our Mission:</h3>
          <p>
            Our mission is to change the future for impoverished people around
            the world by supplying the power of renewable energy, revolutionary
            LED light solutions, and educational workshops that will sustain
            their communities for generations to come.
          </p>
          <h3 style={{ color: "#ffc529" }}>What We Do:</h3>
          <p>
            Our goal is to ensure all people have access to light, electricity,
            clean water, and sanitary cooking facilities by using cutting edge
            LED light technology. This includes white LEDs for energy-efficient
            lighting, RGB LEDs for growing food, and UV LEDs for
            sanitization/disinfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            By providing the technology and workshops on how to use the
            technology, we hope to make low-income, impoverished communities
            safer, healthier, and more sustainable.

            Founder and CEO of the Global Lighting Project, Jack Dubord, is a
            father, a musician, and an entrepreneur. As a business owner, he has
            been working in the industry of renewable energy and efficient
            lighting for over 20 years. <br />
            <hr />
            <br />
            Where did it begin? <br />
            <hr />
            At the age of 17, Jack discovered that venues where his band were
            scheduled to play were a hundred times more welcoming if he designed
            and built light structures to use at their shows. That clever little
            discovery soon became more than a hobby for him. He turned it into a
            business.
            <br /> <hr />
            Over time, he made key contacts with large, high-tech manufacturers,
            as well as clients looking for large quantities of the kinds of
            things he’d learned to build. With a little luck and a lot of hard
            work, he build his first company, SLN Signs. In 2004, he started a
            second company called LEDPAC, and focused on the emerging technology
            of LED lighting.
            <br /> <hr />
            He has now successfully sold this amazing technology for over two
            decades, and the versatility and uses of LED lights continue to
            astound him. However, eventually, he came to realize that he could
            do so much more; that it is not only those with money and resources
            who deserve this technology. It could be used for good – for those
            less fortunate.
            <br /> <hr />
            LED and light technology has been a hobby, passion, and career for
            Jack. As a child, he was blessed to have access to lights he could
            experiment and build with; something not everyone has. That is why
            he decided to share his passion, hobby, and life's work with the
            rest of the world, and to utilize it to enrich and benefit the lives
            of others.
            <br /> <hr />
            And that’s when the Global Lighting Project became more than an
            idea; it became a reality.
            {/*} I began my interest with lighting at age 17, discovering that venues
