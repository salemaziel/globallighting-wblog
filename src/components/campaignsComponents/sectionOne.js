          <br />
          <p>
            The COVID-19 virus has spread around the globe at a relently fast pace, unprecedented in modern times. It is highly contagious, remaining alive on contaminated surfaces for days, and is able to be spread widely and quickly by unaware carriers, due to its incubation period lasting up to 14 days.
            </p>
            <p>
            Healthcare workers are especially at risk. With emergency equipment like masks and ventilators in short supply nation-wide, hospitals need other solutions to keep our doctors, nurses, and other staff as safe from catching the very disease they are trying to treat.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
            <strong>Our solution: UltraViolet LED Lights.</strong></p><br /><p>
            
            UV is a known disinfectant for water, air, and other surfaces, and when applied correctly can be used to mitigate the risk of both viral and bacterial pathogens, two of which include the genetically-related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV coronaviruses.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            With access to powerful UV-C LED lights, the Global Lighting Project is in a unique position to supply aid to some of the unsung heroes of our society that are healthcare workers.
          </p>

              <strong><em>But we need your help.</em></strong>
