              UV-C light has been used <strong>for over 40 years </strong> to disinfect drinking
              water, waste water, air, pharmaceutical products, and surfaces
              against a wide range of human pathogens. To date, hundreds of
              various bacteria and viruses tested have been shown to be
              responsive to UV disinfection at various doses. [3]
