            The COVID-19 virus has spread around the globe at a relentlessly
            fast pace. It is highly contagious, remaining alive on contaminated

            carriers unaware they’ve even been exposed – especially healthcare
            workers.

            LED lights offer a quick and highly energy efficient method of
            delivering ultraviolet rays compared to traditional mercury UV
            lamps. In addition, they turn on instantaneously, contain no
            mercury, and require only 5-10% of the energy required by
            traditional UV lamps.

            <p><span>
              The Global Lighting project is a 501c3 non-profit organization
              whose mission is to ensure all people have access to light,
              electricity, clean water, and sanitary cooking facilities by using
              cutting edge LED light technology. Originally founded in 2016, the
              Global Lighting Project team first set out to bring energy and
              light to impoverished communities in India, where many live daily
              without access to light or electricity.</span></p>
              <p>
              <br />
              Today, however, we’re ready and willing to shift our focus to help
              meet the global pandemic by transporting this LED technology to
              wherever it’s needed most.

        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
        UV-C LED light-fitted COVID-19 killing wands. We are finalizing research on the most efficient and cost-effective method to distribute instruments fitted with UV-C LED light diodes. Currently, one of our favored solutions is an industrial wand with LED diodes attached to one side.
        </p>
        <p>
        Medical equipment such as masks, gowns, and various hospital surface areas could be disinfected on demand by a single person, waving the wand slowly over the exposed surface area.
        </p>
        <p>
        Other solutions include light structures with powerful LED diodes facing all directions that can be turned on and off remotely. These structures can be placed in hospital rooms or other enclosed areas and turned on for a short period of time to disinfect everything in the room the light touches.
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>And this is where you come in.</em></strong></p>
        <p>
        You can help change the world.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a nonprofit, we rely on community support to do what we do best – supply LED light to the rest of the world. Your gift, no matter how small, will help us be a shining light during this difficult time because our light can kill COVID-19!
